# Automatic Pokemon Releasing for Sword/Shield

Make sure boxes are completely filled with only pokemon that you want to release.  Current box should be the left most of the ones you want to release.  First save, then set the cursor to the top left most slot in the box, disconnect your controller, and finally connect the arduino.

#### Thanks

Thanks to https://github.com/kidGodzilla/woff-grinder for updating the project and enabling the use of Arduinos.

Thanks to https://github.com/bertrandom/snowball-thrower for the updated information which modifies the original script to throw snowballs in Zelda. This C Source is much easier to start from, and has a nice object interface for creating new command sequences.

Thanks to Shiny Quagsire for his [Splatoon post printer](https://github.com/shinyquagsire23/Switch-Fightstick) and progmem for his [original discovery](https://github.com/progmem/Switch-Fightstick).

Thanks to [exsilium](https://github.com/bertrandom/snowball-thrower/pull/1) for improving the command structure, optimizing the waiting times, and handling the failure scenarios. It can now run indefinitely!
